### Hi, I'm Lucía 👋

I am a Biomedical Engineering Master's Student at ETH Zürich fully funded by ["la Caixa"](https://becarios.fundacionlacaixa.org/en/lucia-pancorbo-fernandez-B006072) and with the support of “Rafael del Pino” foundation. I did my Bachelor's in Biomedical Engineering at Universidad Carlos III de Madrid (Spain), with an exchange semester at the Nanyang Technological University of Singapore.

## 💼 Practical Experience
- 🧬 Graduate Researcher at the **Mahmood Lab** (Harvard University & BWH), integrating morphological and genetic information using paired histological images and spatial transcriptomics data (Python).
- 🔬 Graduate Researcher at the **Multi-Scale Functional & Molecular Imaging Lab** (ETH Zürich), worked in the reconstruction and processing of optoacoustic cardiac data (Python).
- ❤️ Undergraduate Researcher at **EP Analytics Lab** (Polytechnic University of Valencia), developed a metric to quantify the heterogeneity of electrical propagation in cardiac tissue (MATLAB).
