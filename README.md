### Hi, I'm Lucía 👋

I am a Biomedical Engineering Master's Student at ETH Zürich fully funded by ["la Caixa"](https://becarios.fundacionlacaixa.org/en/lucia-pancorbo-fernandez-B006072) and with the support of “Rafael del Pino” foundation. I did my Bachelor's in Biomedical Engineering at Universidad Carlos III de Madrid (Spain), with an exchange semester at Nanyang Technological University of Singapore.

## 🔍 Practical Experience
- ❤️ Graduate Researcher at the Multi-Scale Functional & Molecular Imaging Lab (University and ETH Zurich), working in the advanced processing of optoacoustic cardiac data (Python).
- 🔬 Undergraduate Researcher at EP Analytics Lab (Polytechnic University of Valencia), developing a metric to quantify the heterogeneity of electrical propagation in cardiac tissue (MATLAB).

## 🌱 Projects
