### Hi, I'm Lucía 👋

I am a Biomedical Engineering Master's Student at ETH Zürich fully funded by ["la Caixa"](https://becarios.fundacionlacaixa.org/en/lucia-pancorbo-fernandez-B006072) and with the support of “Rafael del Pino” foundation. I did my Bachelor's in Biomedical Engineering at Universidad Carlos III de Madrid (Spain), with an exchange semester at the Nanyang Technological University of Singapore.

## 💼 Practical Experience
- 🔬 Graduate Researcher at the **Multi-Scale Functional & Molecular Imaging Lab** (University and ETH Zürich), working in the advanced processing of optoacoustic cardiac data (Python).
- ❤️ Undergraduate Researcher at **EP Analytics Lab** (Polytechnic University of Valencia), developing a metric to quantify the heterogeneity of electrical propagation in cardiac tissue (MATLAB).

## 🌱 Projects
- [Vector Field Heterogeneity (VFH) metric from omnipolar electrograms in high-density catheters](https://github.com/SamuelRuiperezCampillo/L_Pancorbo_S_Ruiperez-Campillo_et_al_IEEE-OJEMB_2024_HVF)
